### RESEARCH INTERESTS

The focus of my research is on the development of statistical methods for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and chromatin interaction (Hi-C) data analysis, and their application to the genetic dissection of complex diseases and traits. In particular, I have developed single-cell aggregated clustering methods (implemented in software SAFE-clustering and SAME-clustering) for flexible, accurate and robust clustering scRNA-seq data. In addition, I also work on batch effect correction for single-cell RNA-seq data, which takes advantages of cell type/cluster information to guide supervised mutual nearest neighbor detection (SMNN method). More recently, I worked on the statistical framework for Hi-C peak calling (MUNIn program), and identifying and characterizing cardiovascular cell types in mouse and the wounding-related cell dynamics in zebrafish.
