### RESEARCH INTERESTS

I am a Research Scientist at Shannon.AI since 2020. Before that, I obtained my M.S. degree at Peking University 
in 2020. My research interests are in natural language processing and deep learning.  
My main work is to track the state-of-the-art algorithms in natural language processing, I not only do research 
on basic NLP algorithms(e.g. QA, adapter, classification..), 
but also explore the practical NLP applications for real-world problems, 
such as document event extraction, text error correction.  
In recent years, with the advancement of pretraining models, I devote myself into multimodel pretraining models. 
For Chinese, I propose a multimodel pretraining model, 
which considers both visual and phonetic information, and this pre-trained model can carry significant syntax and 
semantic information for language understanding.
