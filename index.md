### RESEARCH INTERESTS

I am a Research Scientist at Shannon.AI since 2020. Before that, I obtained my M.S. degree at Peking University 
in 2020. My research interests are in natural language processing and deep learning.  
My main work is to track the state-of-the-art algorithms in natural language processing, I not only do research 
on basic NLP algorithms(e.g. QA, adapter, classification..), 
but also explore the practical NLP applications for real-world problems, 
such as document event extraction, text error correction.  
In recent years, with the advancement of pretraining models, I devote myself into multimodel pretraining models. 
For Chinese, I propose a multimodel pretraining model, 
which considers both visual and phonetic information, and this pre-trained model can carry significant syntax and 
semantic information for language understanding.

### INTERNSHIP
2018.6 - 2019.4:  <b>research intern</b><br/>
Advisor: [Dr. Jiwei Li](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~bdlijiwei/) <br/>
Topics: Question Answering, Event Extraction<br/>
- Proposed a new paradigm for the task of entity-relation extraction. 
  By casting the task as a multi-turn question answering problem, 
  the extraction of entities and relations is transformed to the task of identifying 
  answer spans from the context.
- Created a novel strategy for the task of named entity recognition (NER). 
  We cast the task as a query-based machine reading comprehension task.
- Implemented a Knowledge Base Question Answering System(KBQA) for stock market, 
  the pipeline includes tagging, parsing, nl2sql.

2018.6 - 2019.4:  <b>research assistant</b><br/>
Advisor: [Sujian Li]()<br/>
Topics: Event Extraction, Graph Convolutional Networks<br/>
- Proposed a multi-view graph convolutional networks for the task of event extraction.
- Introduced shortcut arcs (e.g. AMR, Parse tree, Syntax Tree) to enhance information flow.
- Captured the very long-distance dependencies by graph convolutional neural network.
